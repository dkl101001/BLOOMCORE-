# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

**Read this carefully before contributing to BLOOMCORE.**

By submitting a contribution (code, documentation, tests, or other materials)
to BLOOMCORE, you agree to the terms of this Contributor License Agreement
("Agreement").

This Agreement exists to protect:
- contributors,
- maintainers,
- and the long-term continuity of the project.

## 2. Purpose of this Agreement

- Commercial license (closed-source use)

This CLA ensures that contributions may be:
- maintained coherently,
- redistributed under AGPL-3.0, and
- included in future commercial licenses.

Without a CLA, dual licensing is not legally possible.

royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license** to:

Contributor attribution may appear in commit history or documentation,
but does not override project stewardship.

Submitting a Contribution does not obligate Licensor to:
- provide support,
- maintain compatibility,
- or include the Contribution.

the laws of the jurisdiction used for the Project’s commercial agreements,
