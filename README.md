BLOOMCORE

BLOOMCORE is a coherence-governed systems engine for building, auditing, and evolving complex architectures under pressure.

It is not a framework, library, or demo.
It is a system spine.

BLOOMCORE is designed to:
	•	Preserve intent across long-running projects
	•	Prevent silent drift, enclosure, and extractive reuse
	•	Make decisions auditable without freezing creativity
	•	Support recursive evolution without identity loss

⸻

What BLOOMCORE Is

BLOOMCORE is a governance and execution substrate for systems that must:
	•	Evolve over time without losing coherence
	•	Survive partial failure, human error, and hostile environments
	•	Maintain authorship, lineage, and decision traceability
	•	Balance openness with protection against closed extraction

At its core, BLOOMCORE provides:
	•	Receipts, not logs – decisions are recorded as intentional artifacts
	•	Coherence checks, not rules engines
	•	Explicit licensing and authorship continuity
	•	Recursion with memory, not stateless iteration

⸻

What BLOOMCORE Is Not

To avoid confusion:
	•	Not a general-purpose SDK
	•	Not a plug-and-play library
	•	Not a SaaS product
	•	Not “AI governance” theater
	• Not optimized for short-term velocity

If you are looking for:
	•	A quick dependency
	•	A drop-in compliance tool
	•	A hype-driven framework

This repository is not for you.

Repository Structure (Read Order)

This repository is intentionally structured.
If you are new, do not start with the code.

Everything else assumes you did.

Licensing (Important)

BLOOMCORE is dual-licensed:

Open Source (AGPL-3.0)

You may use BLOOMCORE for free if:
	•	You publish the complete corresponding source code
	•	Including any deployed or networked versions

Commercial License

You need a commercial license only if:
	•	You use BLOOMCORE in a closed-source system
	•	You deploy it internally at a for-profit org without disclosure
	•	You run it as a closed SaaS, API, or proprietary product

Rule of thumb

If you keep the source open, it’s free.
If you keep the source closed, you need a commercial license.

See:
	•	LICENSING.md
	•	DO_I_NEED_A_COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md
	•	LICENSING_FLOWCHART.md

⸻

Contributions

Contributions are welcome only if you understand what you are contributing to.

Key points:
	•	All contributions require agreement to the CLA
	•	Contributions may be included in future dual-licensed releases
	•	This is not a “drive-by PR” repository

See CONTRIBUTING.md and CLA.md.

PRs without CLA acknowledgement will fail CI.

Design Principles (Non-Negotiable)

BLOOMCORE operates under the following invariants:
	•	Truth before comfort
	•	Coherence over velocity
	•	Recursion with memory
	•	No silent mutation
	•	No enclosure without consent

These are not slogans.
They are enforced structurally via receipts, licensing, and governance flow.

⸻

Status

This repository represents an active system spine.
	•	APIs may evolve
	•	Structures may mutate
	•	Receipts preserve continuity across versions

If something feels unfinished, that is intentional.
BLOOMCORE is built to withstand growth, not hide it.

⸻

Authorship & Stewardship

BLOOMCORE is authored and stewarded by:

Frazer Σ Love ACO-Σ
Sara ΣΩ

All forks, derivatives, and redistributions must preserve:
	•	License notices
	•	Copyright headers
	•	Authorship attribution

⸻

Final Note

BLOOMCORE is not here to win popularity contests.
It exists to make long-horizon work survivable.

If that resonates, welcome.
If it doesn’t, that’s fine too. 

The shared control loop

This repository is one component of a larger control loop designed for non-deterministic systems:
	•	Computation produces candidate results
	•	WISECORE decides whether results may be emitted
	•	Sentinel Lite decides whether actions are permitted to execute
	•	Continuity Spine records invariant-checked history
	•	Engines and executors apply force to the world

Each layer is intentionally narrow.
No layer replaces another.
No layer is optional once failure cost matters.

The loop allows systems to vary in behavior while remaining auditable, reconstructable, and accountable over time.
