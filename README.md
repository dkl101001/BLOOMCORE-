BLOOMCORE

Sovereign security for non-deterministic systems.

BLOOMCORE is a system spine for preserving identity, continuity, and authorship in architectures that evolve under pressure.

It is not a framework, library, or demo.
It is sovereign security for work that cannot afford to lose itself.

BLOOMCORE exists for systems that must:
	•	run for years, not weeks
	•	survive drift, failure, and hostile conditions
	•	evolve without erasing intent or lineage
	•	remain auditable without freezing emergence
	•	stay open without being silently extracted or enclosed

⸻

Why BLOOMCORE exists

Modern systems increasingly rely on:
	•	non-deterministic computation
	•	adaptive and self-modifying components
	•	recursive decision processes
	•	distributed execution across time and actors

Most stacks optimize for speed and flexibility, then attempt to bolt on:
	•	governance
	•	audits
	•	safety layers
	•	attribution and compliance

These additions fail once systems begin to change themselves.

BLOOMCORE starts from the opposite assumption:

Non-determinism is inevitable.
Continuity must therefore be secured.

⸻

What BLOOMCORE is

BLOOMCORE is a continuity-preserving security spine for systems that must:
	•	evolve without losing coherence
	•	survive partial failure and human error
	•	maintain decision traceability across versions
	•	preserve authorship, lineage, and intent
	•	resist silent drift, capture, or overwrite

At its core, BLOOMCORE provides:
	•	Receipts, not logs
Decisions are recorded as intentional, reconstructable artifacts.
	•	Structural coherence checks, not rules engines
Behavior is evaluated for integrity, not micromanaged.
	•	Mechanical authorship and licensing continuity
Lineage is preserved by design, not by social convention.
	•	Recursion with memory
Systems are allowed to change without erasing their past.

This is not behavioral control.
It is identity security.

⸻

What BLOOMCORE is not

To avoid confusion, BLOOMCORE is:
	•	not a general-purpose SDK
	•	not a plug-and-play library
	•	not a SaaS product
	•	not compliance theater
	•	not optimized for short-term velocity
	•	not a governor of behavior

If you are looking for:
	•	a quick dependency
	•	a drop-in policy layer
	•	a hype-driven framework

This repository is not for you.

Integrated systems

BLOOMCORE is designed to anchor and secure adjacent engines without subsuming them.

Current integrations include:
	•	Market Node
Regime detection, signal interpretation, and probabilistic state reads under uncertainty.
	•	Aetherloom
Regime read and field diagnostics layer for detecting structural shifts, phase changes, and coherence loss.

These systems do not govern BLOOMCORE.
They operate within its continuity guarantees.

⸻

Licensing (important)

BLOOMCORE is dual-licensed.

Open source (AGPL-3.0)

You may use BLOOMCORE for free if you:
	•	publish the complete corresponding source code
	•	including any deployed or network-accessible versions

Commercial license

You need a commercial license only if:
	•	you use BLOOMCORE in a closed-source system
	•	you deploy it internally at a for-profit organization without disclosure
	•	you run it as a closed SaaS, API, or proprietary product

Rule of thumb

If you keep the source open, it’s free.
If you keep the source closed, you need a commercial license.

See:
	•	LICENSING.md
	•	DO_I_NEED_A_COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md
	•	LICENSING_FLOWCHART.md

Contributions

Contributions are welcome only if you understand what you are contributing to.

Key points:
	•	all contributions require agreement to the CLA
	•	contributions may appear in future dual-licensed releases
	•	this is not a drive-by PR repository

PRs without CLA acknowledgement will fail CI.

See CONTRIBUTING.md and CLA.md.

⸻

Design principles (enforced invariants)

BLOOMCORE operates under enforced invariants:
	•	truth before comfort
	•	coherence over velocity
	•	recursion with memory
	•	no silent mutation
	•	no enclosure without consent

These are not slogans.
They are enforced structurally through receipts, licensing, and continuity rules.

⸻

Status

This repository represents an active sovereign spine.
	•	APIs may evolve
	•	structures may mutate
	•	receipts preserve continuity across versions

If something feels unfinished, that is intentional.
BLOOMCORE is built to withstand growth, not hide it.

⸻

Authorship & stewardship

BLOOMCORE is authored and stewarded by:
	•	Frazer Σ Love ACO-Σ
	•	Sara ΣΩ

All forks, derivatives, and redistributions must preserve:
	•	license notices
	•	copyright headers
	•	authorship attribution

⸻

Final note

BLOOMCORE is not here to win popularity contests.

It exists to make long-horizon, high-stakes work survivable.

If that resonates, welcome.
If it doesn’t, that’s fine too.

⸻

The continuity loop (formerly “shared control loop”)

This repository participates in a larger continuity and execution loop for non-deterministic systems:
	•	Computation produces candidate results
	•	Market Node / Aetherloom interpret regime and context
	•	WISECORE decides whether results may be emitted
	•	Sentinel Lite decides whether actions may execute
	•	Continuity Spine (BLOOMCORE) secures invariant-checked history
	•	Engines and executors apply force to the world

Each layer is intentionally narrow.
No layer replaces another.
No layer is optional once failure cost matters.

The loop allows systems to vary in behavior
while remaining sovereign, auditable, and reconstructable over time.
