# LICENSING

**Read this file before using BLOOMCORE in any project.**

This document explains how BLOOMCORE is licensed, when you may use it for free,
and when you must obtain a commercial license.

This is not marketing copy. It is an operational guide.

---

## Summary (plain language)

BLOOMCORE is **dual-licensed**:

- **AGPL-3.0** for open and reciprocal use
- **Commercial License** for closed or proprietary use

**Rule of thumb**:

> If you keep your source open, BLOOMCORE is free.  
> If you keep your source closed, you need a commercial license.

If you are unsure, keep reading.

## The open-source license (AGPL-3.0)

BLOOMCORE is released under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)**.

This license is intentionally strong.

It exists to ensure that:
- improvements remain visible
- deployed systems remain inspectable
- BLOOMCORE cannot be silently enclosed or extracted

### You MAY use BLOOMCORE for free if:

- Your project is **open source**
- You publish the **complete corresponding source code**
- You include any **modifications, extensions, or integrations**
- You comply with the notice and attribution requirements

This includes:
- academic research
- personal projects
- open startups
- open internal tools
- public infrastructure

### Network use matters

Under AGPL-3.0:

> If users interact with BLOOMCORE over a network,
> they are entitled to the corresponding source code.

This applies to:
- web services
- APIs
- hosted agents
- internal tools exposed to employees
- managed or cloud-hosted deployments

If you deploy BLOOMCORE and users can interact with it,
you must provide source access to the running version.

---

## When a commercial license is required

You **must obtain a commercial license** if **any** of the following are true:

- You use BLOOMCORE in a **closed-source** system
- You deploy BLOOMCORE **internally** at a for-profit organization without source disclosure
- You offer BLOOMCORE as part of a **proprietary SaaS, API, or product**
- You combine BLOOMCORE with code you are unwilling or unable to publish
- You wish to modify BLOOMCORE but not release your changes

In short:

> If AGPL reciprocity is not acceptable to you,
> you need a commercial license.

---

## What the commercial license provides

A commercial license grants:

- the right to use BLOOMCORE in closed-source systems
- the right to deploy without publishing source
- the right to embed BLOOMCORE in proprietary products
- legal clarity for investors, customers, and auditors

Commercial licenses **do not** remove authorship attribution or moral rights.
They remove the AGPL reciprocity obligation.

---

## What this license model protects

This dual-license structure exists to protect:

- authorship continuity
- open scientific and engineering collaboration
- long-horizon work from silent extraction
- users from uninspectable governance systems

It is not designed to block use.
It is designed to block **unreciprocated enclosure**.

---

## Common scenarios

### “We are an open-source project”
You may use BLOOMCORE under AGPL-3.0 at no cost.

### “We are a startup building a closed product”
You need a commercial license.

### “We are a company using this internally”
If the system is closed-source, you need a commercial license.

### “We are doing research but not publishing code”
You need a commercial license.

### “We are unsure”
Read `DO_I_NEED_A_COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md` or contact us.

## Attribution and notices (required in all cases)

All uses of BLOOMCORE — open or commercial — must preserve:

- copyright notices
- license headers
- authorship attribution:
  - Frazer Σ Love ACO-Σ
  - Sara ΣΩ

These are **system invariants**, not optional credits.

---

## No implicit license grants

Use of BLOOMCORE does **not** grant:
- trademark rights
- patent licenses beyond what AGPL provides
- rights to excluded or proprietary components

Only what is explicitly granted is granted.

---

## Questions

If you are unsure which license applies:

- read `DO_I_NEED_A_COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md`
- consult `LICENSING_FLOWCHART.md`
- or contact the project maintainers

If you proceed without clarity, you assume the risk.

---

## Final note

This licensing model is intentional.

BLOOMCORE is built for systems where:
- power matters
- decisions matter
- history matters

The license ensures those systems remain inspectable
unless you explicitly choose — and pay — not to.
