# PRICING

This document explains how BLOOMCORE commercial licensing is priced and how to think about cost.

If you are using BLOOMCORE under **AGPL-3.0**, this file does not apply to you.

---

## Core principle

BLOOMCORE pricing is based on **enclosure, not usage**.

You are not paying for:
- downloads
- compute
- seats
- requests
- tokens
- scale

You are paying for the right to:
- keep your system closed
- avoid AGPL reciprocity
- deploy without source disclosure

If you keep your source open, BLOOMCORE is free.

---

## What the commercial license covers

A commercial license grants the right to:

- use BLOOMCORE in closed-source systems
- deploy BLOOMCORE internally without source disclosure
- embed BLOOMCORE in proprietary products
- operate BLOOMCORE as a closed SaaS or API
- modify BLOOMCORE without publishing changes

Authorship attribution remains required.

---

## Pricing model (high level)

Commercial licenses are priced according to **organizational context**, not feature access.

Factors considered:
- organization size
- deployment scope (internal vs external)
- revenue model (product, service, infrastructure)
- risk profile and compliance burden
- duration of license

There is **no per-seat or per-request pricing**.

## Indicative tiers (guidance, not a menu)

These tiers are provided for orientation only.
Final pricing is set by written agreement.

### Individual / Small Team

Typical profile:
- 1–5 people
- early-stage or solo founder
- closed prototype or pilot

**Indicative range:** low four figures (annual)

---

### Startup / Small Company

Typical profile:
- venture-backed or revenue-generating
- closed-source product or SaaS
- external users

**Indicative range:** mid four to low five figures (annual)

---

### Enterprise / Infrastructure

Typical profile:
- large organization
- internal or customer-facing deployment
- regulatory, safety, or compliance exposure

**Indicative range:** five figures and up (annual)

---

## What pricing is *not* based on

Pricing is not tied to:
- number of repositories
- number of deployments
- number of users
- amount of code reused
- downstream revenue share

BLOOMCORE does not meter creativity.

---

## Discounts and special cases

We will consider:
- academic institutions
- public-interest infrastructure
- non-profit or cooperative projects
- open research transitioning to partial closure

Case-by-case evaluation applies.

---

## Renewal and term

Commercial licenses are typically:
- annual
- renewable
- non-transferable

Multi-year terms may be negotiated.

---

## What you are actually paying for

You are paying for:
- legal clarity
- freedom to enclose
- investor and customer certainty
- the option to keep proprietary work proprietary

You are **not** paying for support, hosting, or services unless separately agreed.

---

## How to proceed

If you believe you need a commercial license:

1. Read `LICENSING.md`
2. Confirm via `DO_I_NEED_A_COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md`
3. Review `LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.txt`
4. Contact the maintainers for pricing and terms

---

## Final note

BLOOMCORE is priced to be:
- fair
- sustainable
- hostile to silent extraction

If the price feels high, the open-source option exists.

If the open-source option feels risky, that is what the commercial license is for.
